        <em> Scenario: </em> You are a student in an introductory calculus class in college. Before every quiz, your professor gives you a practice quiz, then allows you to study for 20 minutes (in case you didn't study on behalf of taking an accidental nap) before taking the graded quiz.
      </p>
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
      <p>
        <em> Task: </em> Take the practice quiz, then try to learn as much as possible about the concepts from the quiz, then take the graded quiz.
