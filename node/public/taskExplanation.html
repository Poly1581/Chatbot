    Study Task
  </h1>
  <p>
    <em> Scenario: </em> You are a student in an introductory calculus class in college. Before every quiz, your professor gives you a practice quiz, then allows you to study for 20 minutes (in case you didn't study on behalf of taking an accidental nap) before taking the graded quiz.
  </p>
  <p>
    <em> Task: </em> Take the practice quiz, then try to learn as much as possible about the concepts from the quiz, then take the graded quiz.
